Memory Leak in tail - Issues with swapping entire arrays or swapping geometries, can't dynamically update.

Solution - Pre allocate array, write shift loop myself, initialize all points to be at ship location at first. 


Boring background - plain black is laaaaaaame 

Solution - circle with cool texture. low specular intensity so some space doesn't look lighter than others


Glow - most shaders not working for opengl

postprocess bloom blooms everything.
